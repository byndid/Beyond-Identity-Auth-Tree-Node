# Beyond Identity

Beyond Identity provides the most secure authentication platform in the world. Breaking down barriers between cybersecurity, identity, and device management, Beyond Identity fundamentally changes the way the world logs in–eliminating passwords and providing users with a frictionless multi-factor login experience. Beyond passwordless, the company provides the zero-trust access needed to secure hybrid work environments, where tightly controlling which users and which devices are accessing critical cloud resources has become essential.

The advanced platform collects dozens of user and device risk signals during each login - enabling customers to enforce continuous, risk-based access control. The innovative architecture replaces passwords with the proven asymmetric cryptography that underpins TLS and protects trillions of dollars of transactions daily. Customers turn to Beyond Identity to stop cyberattacks, protect their most critical data, and meet compliance requirements

3. Click “Save”


### Step 7: Configure Beyond Identity as the OAuth2 Provider Service

This is used to set BeyondIdentity as the default tree for OIDC clients.

1. In the AM console, navigate to Realms > Realm Name > Services > OAuth2 Provider Service.

2. Click on “Advanced”.

3. Custom login URL Template:

```javascript
http://<your_am_domain>?service=BeyondIdentity&goto=${goto}<#if acrValues??>&acr_values=${acrValues}</#if><#if realm??>&realm=${realm}</#if><#if module??>&module=${module}</#if><#if service??>&service=${service}</#if><#if locale??>&locale=${locale}</#if>:
```

4. Click on “Save Changes”.


## Setting up Test Users

### User Enrollment

1. To enroll (provision) a user in the Beyond Identity experience:

   Use a SCIM Connector and provision users from ForgeRock to Beyond Identity.

   To configure SCIM Connector in ForgeRock refer to: https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idm/7/connector-reference/chap-scim.html
   
   SCIM API Endpoints:
   
   https://api.byndid.com/scim/v2/Users

   https://api.byndid.com/scim/v2/Groups


2. Enrolled user will receive an email from Beyond Identity welcoming them to the new Identity Provider.

   See image below for reference:

![BI Enrollment Email](https://github.com/byndid/forgerock/blob/master/bi_enrollment_email.png)

3. Each enrolled user will be asked to follow the two steps below:

   Step 1: Download the Beyond Identity Authenticator to their device.

   When the user clicks “View Download Options”, the Beyond Identity Authenticator downloads page will open in a browser with all supported platforms displayed. 
   
   The user should download and install the Beyond Identity Authenticator on their device if they have not already.

   Now that the user has the Authenticator installed on their device, they should proceed to Step 2 as there is not yet a user credential associated with the   Authenticator on that device.

   Step 2: Register their Credential in the Beyond Identity IdP.

   By clicking on Step 2 “Register New Credential”, the user’s credential will get enrolled in the Beyond Identity service on the back end. On the front end, users who click Step 2 will be taken to the Beyond Identity Authenticator where they will see the progress of their credential registration. Once completed, the user will see a credentials in the Authenticator. 
   
   See example image below:

![BI Authenticator](https://github.com/byndid/forgerock/blob/master/bi_authenticator.png)

## User Authentication (Signing in)

1. Each enrolled user can visit their ForgeRock instance or any application supported by your SSO to sign into their corporate applications. 

2. The ForgeRock application or SSO-supported application will display a link to sign in using Beyond Identity.

3. The user should click on the link to be signed into their application, without the use of a password. The Beyond Identity app along with a success notification will display.

   Note: For iOS devices, some application sign-in processes will ask the user to exit out of the Beyond Identity Authenticator to return to their app after successful authentication.

## User Deprovisioning

To deprovision the users, use the same SCIM Connector described above.
